# Jasmine Core 3.10 Release Notes

## New features and bug fixes

* Added support for running Jasmine multiple times
  * If the env is configured with `autoCleanClosures: false`, then it can be
    executed repeatedly.
  * Merges #1934 from @nicojs
  * Fixes #1925

* Improved error message when an async expectation occurs after the spec
  finishes
  * Merges #1937 from @AndreWillomitzer
  * Fixes #1854

* Reject timeout values that are too large for setTimeout

  error to be routed to the correct spec/suite.

    * Fixes #1923.

* The jasmine-core Ruby gem now prints a deprecation message when loaded unless
  the SUPPRESS_JASMINE_DEPRECATION environment variable is set.
